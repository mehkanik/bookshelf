Bookshelf
=========

This is my attempt to fill the void for an open sourced, self-hosted, functional and distraction-free website built by a writer for writers.

Many hours fidgeting with convoluted CMS or blog systems lead me to the following ideals that I want to use to guide the development of this project:

- The platform a writer uses should not distract them from their writing.
- The platform should remain functional enough to make publishing easy.
- The platform should make reading as streamlined as publishing.
- The platform should be as painless for one user or many users to use.

Plans
=========

This project will mostly be written using a python framework (I don't like PHP, sue me), most likely [bottlepy](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/). I intend to make use of bootstrap, LESS, node.js and jQuery throughout this project as well.

Serving can involve one of bottlepy's default development servers, although it should also be possible with uWSGI and Nginx.

Deployment is a far ways down the road, but I intend for it to be as simple and streamlined as possible; that way the person setting it up can focus more on *using* the software rather than setting it up.

You can see design concepts I have in mind over [yonder](https://github.com/mehkanik/bookshelf/wiki/Bookshelf%27s-Features). I also intend for there to be real-time collaboration amongst groups working together on various writing projects.
