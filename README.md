Bookshelf
=========

This is my attempt to fill the void for an open sourced, self-hosted, functional and distractionless website built by a writer for writers.

Many hours fidgeting with convoluted CMS or blog systems lead me to the following ideals that I want to use to guide the development of this project:

- The platform a writer uses should not distract them from their writing.
- The platform should remain functional enough to make publishing easy.
- The platform should make reading as streamlined as publishing.
- The platform should be painless for one user or many users to use.

Plans
=========

This project will mostly be written using a python framework (I don't like PHP, sue me), most likely [bottlepy](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/). I intend to make use of bootstrap, LESS, node.js and jQuery throughout this project as well.

Deployment will involve one of bottlepy's default development servers, although it should be possible with uWSGI and Nginx.
